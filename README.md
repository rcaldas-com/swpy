## Automate maintenance in managed switches

I wrote this from the need to update the firmware and enable the ssh module of 100+ Extreme Networks Switches in a park of 900+ Switches (in major Enterasys A2,B3,B5,C5... models). 

The initial project was to update the Radius authentication setting of the 900+ switches to our new Radius server in a batch, that original code will be mixed with this one by the time.
